Design patterns are used to represent the pattern used by developers to create software or web application. These patterns are selected based on the requirement analysis. The patterns describe the solution to the problem, when and where to apply the solution and the consequences of the implementation.

Structure of a design pattern
The documentation of design pattern is maintained in a way that focuses more on the technology that is used and in what ways. The following diagram explains the basic structure of design pattern documentation.

Pattern Name
It describes the pattern in short and effective manner.

Intent/Motive
It describes what the pattern does.

Applicability
It describes the list of situations where pattern is applicable.

Participants and consequences
Participants include classes and objects that participate in the design pattern with a list of consequences that exist with the pattern.

Why Python?
Python is an open source scripting language. It has libraries that support a variety of design patterns. The syntax of python is easy to understand and uses English keywords.

Python provides support for the list of design patterns that are mentioned below. These design patterns will be used throughout this tutorial −

* Model View Controller Pattern
* Singleton pattern
* Factory pattern
* Builder Pattern
* Prototype Pattern
* Facade Pattern
* Command Pattern
* Adapter Pattern
* Prototype Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Proxy Pattern
* Chain of Responsibility Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* State Pattern
* Strategy Pattern
* Template Pattern
* Flyweight Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern
* Object Oriented Pattern
* Benefits of using design pattern

Following are the different benefits of design pattern −

* Patterns provide developer a selection of tried and tested solutions for the specified problems.
* All design patterns are language neutral.
* Patterns help to achieve communication and maintain well documentation.
* It includes a record of accomplishment to reduce any technical risk to the project.
* Design patterns are highly flexible to use and easy to understand.

Python is an open source scripting language, which is high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented. It is designed to be highly readable. The syntax of Python language is easy to understand and uses English keywords frequently.

Features of Python Language
In this section, we will learn about the different features of Python language.

Interpreted
Python is processed at runtime using the interpreter. There is no need to compile program before execution. It is similar to PERL and PHP.

Object-Oriented
Python follows object-oriented style and design patterns. It includes class definition with various features like encapsulation, polymorphism and many more.

Portable
Python code written in Windows operating system and can be used in Mac operating system. The code can be reused and portable as per the requirements.

Easy to code
Python syntax is easy to understand and code. Any developer can understand the syntax of Python within few hours. Python can be described as “programmer-friendly”

Extensible
If needed, a user can write some of Python code in C language as well. It is also possible to put python code in source code in different languages like C++. This makes Python an extensible language.

Important Points
Consider the following important points related to Python programming language −

* It includes functional and structured programming methods as well as object-oriented programming methods.
* It can be used as scripting language or as a programming language.
* It includes automatic garbage collection.
* It includes high-level dynamic data types and supports various dynamic type checking.
* Python includes a feature of integration with C, C++ and languages like Java.
